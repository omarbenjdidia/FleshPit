  description: Sulfur is like a little stinky monster that can make our noses wrinkle.
    It's in rotten eggs and even some hot springs. But don't worry, sulfur can also
    make some beautiful crystals and help us in many ways. So let's give a thumbs
    up to sulfur for being a multi-talented element!
